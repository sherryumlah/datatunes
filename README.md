Google Fusion Tables, Howler.js &amp; Mustache.js

DataTunes is an HTML5 application that utilizes the Howler.js audio library, Mustache.js templates, and JSON to connect to Google’s fusion tables API to retrieve stored song data. The application parses the song data (text strings). The piano notes (individual mp3 files I created using my Yamaha MX61 synthesizer) are assigned to specific characters and string together to form a song. Users can also enter their own stream of characters in the text box and ‘Tunify’ their data. The tempo of the song’s playback can be modified on the fly by adjusting the slider manually.
